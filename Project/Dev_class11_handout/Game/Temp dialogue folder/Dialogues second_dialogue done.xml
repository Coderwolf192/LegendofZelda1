    Masked-
    Well, let's say you'll understand when you grow up. But this is not the moment

    Ogity-
    So you finally arrive, you little nosy brats. Why do you think that if you
    couldn't defeat me in the future you will be able to defeat me now?
    Zelda enfadada-
    Who are you and what do you mean with that?
    Ogity-
    Ohhh! So that petty bitch didn't tell you anyhing? What a surprise! Maybe I
    should tell you the truth... or maybe you prefer to leave behind that column
    from which you are pointing with your bow and tell them your everything.

    Enmascarada entra en escena:
    Masked-
    So you have noticed my presence.
    Zelda preocupada-
    Can someone give me an explanation...?
    Ogity-
    Go ahead, tell them.
    Masked-
    ... This entity and I, we aren't from this time...
    Zelda preocupada-
    What do you mean?
    Masked-
    We came from the future, a future where the Hyrule kingdom no longer exists...
    In a future Hyrule where attacked by a foreign tribe, wich want to steal the
    triforce and take over the kingdom. The people of Hyrule fought with all their
    might, but many of them perish, among them the king and the commander of the hylian
    forces, Link. The tribe finally got the triforce, they were planning to use it to
    open the portal that stays under the palace, to awake the evil power which is
    confined within it. In a final effort, the hyrulian people managed to stop the
    tribe, which being defeated use the power of the triforce to travel back in time.
    I was the only one that could try to stop them, getting trapped in the anomaly and
    traveling with them. And there is where starts the history that you already know...
    Zelda preocupada-
    I-I'm a little bit confused. I-I don't know what to think...My father... Even you
    Link... Bu-but the only thing I have clear is that you are the cause of the
    suffering of my kingdom, and stop you it's my duty.
    Ogity-
    Whatever you say, I suppose I should thank you to come here, you save me a looot of
    work, now if you are so kind, perish just like your beloved kingdom.

    Ogity-
    Getting always in my way is becoming a bad habit of you, you know?
    Masked-
    And it will continue to be as long as you still alive.
    Ogity-
    I don't think so, I finally have the three pieces of the triforce, It's to late to
    stop me, you foolish can't go against your destiny, and now if you'll excuse me...

    Zelda preocupada-
